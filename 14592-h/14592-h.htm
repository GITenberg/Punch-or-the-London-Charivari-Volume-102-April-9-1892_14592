<h3>BOAT-RACE DAY.</h3>

  <blockquote><i>The Reader will kindly imagine that he has crossed
  Hammersmith Bridge, and is being carried along by a jostling stream of
  sightseers towards Mortlake. The banks are already
  occupied&mdash;although it still wants half an hour to the time fixed for
  the start&mdash;by a triple row of the more patient and prudent
  spectators. On the left of the path, various more or less</i> Shady
  Characters <i>have established their "pitches," and are doing their best
  to beguile the unsophisticated.</i></blockquote>

  <p><i>First Shady Character</i> (<i>presiding over a particoloured
  roulette board with a revolving and not unmanageable index</i>). Three to
  one any colour you like! Fairest game in the world! I'm a backin' I'm a
  layin'.... Pop it on, you sportsmen! (<i>Two</i> Sportsmen&mdash;<i>a
  couple of shop-boys</i>&mdash;"<i>pop it on</i>," <i>in coppers</i>.)
  Yaller was your colour&mdash;and it <i>is</i> a yaller cap, sure enough!
  <i>I</i>'m a payin' this time. Try it again! (<i>They do.</i>) Blue's
  your fancy this turn, my lord. And green it <i>is</i>! Good ole Hireland
  for ever! Twenty can play at this game as well as one! Don't be afraid o'
  yer luck&mdash;'ave another go. <i>Red</i> did you put your coppers on?
  And it's <i>yaller</i> again&mdash;and <i>you </i> lose! (<i>The</i>
  Sportsmen <i>pass on&mdash;with empty pockets</i>.) Fairest game
  <i>in</i> the world!</p>

  <p><i>Second S.C.</i> (<i>who has been conducting a Confidence Auction
  from a barrow and egg-box</i>). Well, I 'ope you're all satisfied, and if
  you ain't &mdash;(<i>candidly</i>)&mdash;it don't make no bloomin'
  difference to me, for I'm orf&mdash;these premises is comin' down fur
  alterations. [<i>He gets off the barrow, shoulders the egg-box, and
  departs in search of fresh dupes.</i></p>

  <p><i>A Vendor.</i> Now all you who are fond of a bit o' fun and
  amusement, jest you stop and invest a penny in this little article I am
  now about to introdooce to your notice, warranted to make yer proficient
  in the 'ole art and practice of Photography in the small space of five
  seconds and a arf&mdash;and I think you'll agree with me as it ain't
  possible to become an expert photographer at a smaller expense than the
  sum of one penny. 'Ere I 'old in my 'and a simple little machine,
  consistin' of a small sheet of glorss in a gilt frame. I've been
  vaccinated five 'underd-and-forty-one times, never been bit by a mad dog
  in my life, and all these articles have been thoroughly fumigated before
  leaving the factory, therefore you'll agree with me you needn't be afraid
  o' catchin' the Inflooenza. They tell me it's nearly died out
  now&mdash;and no wonder, with everythink a cure for it&mdash;but this
  article is a <i>certain</i> remedy. All you've got to do is to bite off a
  corner of the glorss, takin' care to be near a public 'ouse at the time,
  chew the glorss into small fragments, enter the public 'ouse, call for a
  pot o' four ale, and drink it orf quick. It operates in this
  way&mdash;the minoot portions of the glorss git between the jaws of the
  microbe, preventin' 'im from closin' 'is mouth, and thereby enablin' you
  to suffocate 'im with the four ale. (<i>To the Reader.</i>) Will you
  allow me to show you how this little invention takes a photograph, Sir?
  kindly 'old it in your 'and, breathe on it, and look steadily on the
  plate for the space of a few seconds. (<i>All of which the Reader, being
  the soul of courtesy, obligingly does&mdash;and is immediately rewarded
  by observing the outline of a donkey's head produced upon the glass.</i>)
  Now if you'll 'and that round, Sir, to allow the company to judge whether
  it ain't a correct likeness&mdash; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [<i>But here the Reader will probably
  prefer to pass on.</i></p>

  <p><i>Third S.C.</i> (<i>who is crouching on ground by a tin case, half
  covered with a rug, and yelling</i>). Ow-ow-ow-ow!... Come an' see the
  wonderful little popsy-wopsy Marmoseet, what kin tork five lengwidges,
  walk round, shake 'ands, tell yer 'is buthday, 'is percise age, and where
  he was keptured!</p>

  <blockquote>[<i>Crowd collects to inspect this zoological phenomenon,
  which&mdash;as soon as an inconvenient Constable is out of
  hearing&mdash;reveals itself as an illicit lottery. Speculators purchase
  numbered tickets freely; balls are shaken up in the tin box&mdash;and the
  popsy-wopsy invariably gets distinctly the best of it.</i></blockquote>

    "I'm ole Billy Fairplay, <i>I</i> am!"
  </div>
  <p><i>Fourth S.C.</i> (<i>an extremely disreputable-looking old
  gentleman, with a cunningly curled piece of tape on a board</i>), 'Ere,
  I'm ole BILLY FAIRPLAY, <i>I</i> am! Come an' try yer fortins at little
  'Ide an' Find! Arf a crown yer don't prick the middle o' this bit o'
  tape. Bet arf a crown, to win five shillin's! (<i>A school-boy sees his
  way to doubling his last tip, and speculates.</i>) Wrong agin, my boy!
  It's old BILLY FAIRPLAY'S luck&mdash;for <i>once</i> in a way!
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [<i>The
  School-boy departs, saddened by this most unexpected result.</i></p>

  <p><i>Fifth S.C.</i> (<i>a fat, fair man, with an impudent frog-face, who
  is trying desperately hard to take in a sceptical crowd with the too
  familiar purse-trick</i>). Now look 'ere, I don't mind tellin' yer all,
  fair <i>an</i>' frank, I'm 'ere to get a bit, if I <i>can</i>; but, if
  you kin ketch me on my <i>merits</i>, why, <i>I</i> shan't
  grumble&mdash;I'll promise yer that much! Well, now&mdash;(<i>to a stolid
  and respectable young Clerk</i>)&mdash;jest to show you don't know
  <i>me</i>, and I don't know <i>you</i>&mdash;(<i>he throws three
  half-crowns into the purse</i>). There, 'old <i>that</i> for me. Shut it.
  (<i>The Clerk does so, grinning.</i>) Thank you&mdash;you're a gentleman,
  though you mayn't look like it&mdash;but perhaps you're one in disguise.
  <i>Now</i> gimme 'arf a crown for it. Yer won't? <i>Any</i> one gimme arf
  a crown for it? Why&mdash;(<i>unprintable language</i>)&mdash;if ever I
  see sech a blanky lot o' mugs in <i>my</i> life! 'Ere, I'll try yer once
  more! (<i>He does.</i>) <i>Now</i> oo'll gimme arf a crown for it? (<i>To
  a Genteel Onlooker, with an eyeglass, who has made an audible
  comment</i>) "See 'ow it's done!" So yer orter, with a glazier's shop
  where yer eye orter be! Well, if anyone had 'a told me I should stand
  'ere, on Boat-Race Day too, orferin' six bob for arf a crown, and no one
  with the ordinary pluck an' straightforwardness to take me at my word,
  I'd have suspected that man of tellin' me a untruth! (<i>To a
  simple-looking spectator.</i>) Will <i>you</i> 'old this purse for me?
  Yer will? Well. I like the manly way yer speak up! (<i>Here the</i> Gent.
  Onl., <i>observing a seedy man slinking about outside, warns the company
  to "mind their pockets"&mdash;which excites the</i> Purse-seller's
  <i>just indignation</i>.) "Ere!&mdash;(<i>to the</i> G.O.) you take
  <i>your</i> 'ook! I've 'ad enough o' you. I 'ave. You're a bloomin' sight
  too officious, <i>you</i> are! Not much in <i>your</i> pockets to
  mind&mdash;'cept the key o' the street, and a ticket o' leave, I'll lay!
  If you carn't beyave as a Gentleman <i>among </i> Gentlemen, go 'ome to
  where you 'ad your 'air cut last&mdash;to Pentonville! (<i>The</i> G.O.
  <i>retires.</i>) There, we shall get along better without '<i>im</i>. 'Ow
  long are you goin' to keep me 'ere? Upon my word an' honour, it's enough
  to sicken a man to see what the world's come to! Where's yer courage?
  Where's yer own common sense? Where's your faith in 'umin nature? What do
  yer <i>expect</i>? (<i>Scathingly.</i>) Want me to wrop it up in a
  porcel, and send it 'ome for yer? Is <i>that</i> what yer waitin' for!
  Dammy, if this goes on, I shall git wild, and take and give the bloomin'
  purse a bath! (<i>The</i> Simple Spectator <i>feels in his
  pockets&mdash;evidently for a half-crown</i>.) 'Ere, <i>you</i> look more
  intelligent than the rest&mdash;I'll try yer jest this once. Jest to show
  yer don't know me, and&mdash;(<i>Shouts of "They're off! They're coming!"
  from the bank; the</i> Purse-seller's <i>audience suddenly melts away,
  leaving him alone with the</i> Seedy Slinker.) 'Ere, JIM, we may as well
  turn it up. 'Ere come them blanky boats!</p>

  <p><i>A Juvenile Plunger</i> (<i>with rather a complicated book on the
  event</i>). If Oxford wins, I've got ter git a penny out of 'im, and if
  Kimebridge wins, you've got ter git a penny outer <i>me</i>!</p>

  <p><i>Crowd</i> (<i>as the Crews flash by</i>). Go it, Oxford!
  Ox&mdash;ford! No, Kimebridge! Well rowed, Kimebridge!... Oxford wins!
  No, it don't. <i>I'll</i> lay it don't! Splendid rycin'. Which on 'em was
  Oxford? The inside one. No, it worn't&mdash;they was <i>outside</i>.
  Well, Oxford was <i>leadin</i>', anyway!... There, <i>that's</i> all over
  till next year! Not much to come out for, either&mdash;on'y just see 'em
  for a second or so. Oh, <i>I</i> come out for the lark of it, <i>I</i>
  do.... There goes the pidgins orf.... We shan't be long knowin' now....
  'Ere's the Press Boat comin' back.... There, wot did I <i>tell</i> yer,

  <p>TWO DROMIOS.&mdash;One day last week at Highgate, a certain or
  uncertain WILLIAM PEA, horsedealer, was summoned by the Police for
  furious driving. The Police knew him well by sight, but not well enough,
  as he clearly proved what <i>Mr. Weller Senior</i> called "a alleybi."
  Evidently Mr. PEA has a double, and "as like as two Peas" is peculiarly

<h3>AN EMPTY TRIUMPH.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>A Story of Show Sunday.</i>)</p>

  <p>It was Show Sunday; lovers of Art were streaming in and out of every
  Studio they could hunt up, fired with a laudable ambition to break the
  record by the number they visited in the hours between luncheon and
  dusk.</p>

  <div class="figleft" style="width:25%;">
      <a href="images/172a.png"><img width="100%" src="images/172a.png"
      alt="Tintoretto Tickler" /></a>
  </div>
  <p>The residence of so rising a painter as TINTORETTO TICKLER was
  naturally a place in which no person of any self-respect would neglect to
  be seen; and on this particular afternoon the entrance-hall,
  sitting-rooms, and studio were simply choked with an eager throng of
  friends, acquaintances, and utter strangers; for TINTORETTO'S lavish
  hospitality was well known, and no expense had been spared to give his
  guests as favourable an impression of his talent as possible. A couple of
  knights, clad in complete steel&mdash;the local greengrocer and an
  Italian model&mdash;took the guests' hats, and announced their names;
  there were daffodils and azaleas in profusion; the Red Roumanians
  performed national airs in the studio-gallery; Italian mandolinists sang
  and strummed on the staircase, and, in the dining-room, trim
  maid-servants, in becoming white caps and streamers, dispensed coffee,
  claret-cup, and ices to a swarm of well-conducted social locusts.</p>

  <p>Just outside his painting-room stood TINTORETTO TICKLER, at the
  receipt of compliment, which was abundantly and cheerfully paid. Indeed,
  the torrent of congratulation and delicately-expressed eulogy was almost
  overwhelming. One lovely and enthusiastic person told him that the sight
  of his "<i>Dryad Disturbing a Beanfeast</i>" had just marked an epoch in
  her mental development, and that she considered it quite the supreme
  achievement of the Art of the Century. A ponderous man in spectacles,
  whom TICKLER had no recollection of having ever met before in his life,
  encouraged him by his solemn assurance that his "<i>Jews Sitting in a
  Dentist's Waiting-room, in the reign of King John</i>," was perfectly
  marvellous in its realism and historical accuracy, and that it ought to
  become the property of the Nation; while an elderly lady, in furs and a
  crimped front, declared that the pathos of his nursery subject&mdash;a
  child endeavouring to induce a mechanical rabbit to share its
  bread-and-milk&mdash;was sending her home with tears in her eyes. Some
  talked learnedly of his "values," his "atmosphere," and the subtlety of
  his modelling; all agreed that he had surpassed himself and every living
  artist by his last year's work, and no one made any mistake about the
  nature of his subjects, perhaps because&mdash;in consideration for the
  necessities of the British Art-patron&mdash;they had been fully announced
  and described in the artistic notes of several Sunday papers.</p>

  <p>When they got outside, it is true, their enthusiasm slightly
  evaporated; TICKLER was going off, he was repeating himself, he had
  nothing that was likely to produce a sensation this year, and most of his
  pictures would probably never be seen again.</p>

  <p>As, however, these last remarks were not made in TINTORETTO'S
  presence, it might have been thought that the unmistakable evidences of
  his success which he did hear would have rendered him a proud and happy
  painter,&mdash;but if he was, all that can be said was that he certainly
  did not look it. He accepted the most effusive tributes with the same
  ghastly and conventional smile; from feminine glances of unutterable
  gratitude and admiration he turned away with an inarticulate mumble and
  an averted eye; at times he almost seemed to be suppressing a squirm. If
  expression is any index to the thoughts, he was neither grateful nor
  gratified, and distinctly uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>A painter-friend of his, who had been patiently watching his
  opportunity to get a word with him as he stood there exchanging
  handshakes, managed at last to get near enough for conversation. "Very
  glad to find there's no truth in it!" he began, cordially. "No truth in
  <i>what</i>!" said TICKLER, a little snappishly, for he was getting
  extremely fractious, "the compliments"?</p>

  <p>"No, no, my dear boy. I mean in what a fellow told me outside just
  now&mdash;that some burglars broke into your studio last night, and
  carried off all your canvasses&mdash;a lie, of course!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, <i>that</i>?" said TICKLER, "that's true enough&mdash;they left
  nothing behind 'em but the beastly frames!"</p>

  <p>"Then what on earth&mdash;&mdash;?" began the other, in perplexity,
  for another group was just coming up, beaming with an ecstasy that
  demanded the relief of instant expression.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;er&mdash;fact is," explained poor TICKLER, in an
  undertone, "I <i>did</i> think of shutting the studio up and getting away
  somewhere&mdash;but my wife wouldn't hear of it, you know; said it would
  be such a pity to have had all the expense and trouble for nothing, and
  didn't believe the mere absence of pictures would make any particular
  difference. And&mdash;er&mdash;I'm bound to say that, as you can see for
  yourself, it <i>hasn't</i>!"</p>

  <p>And even as he spoke, he had to resign himself once more to a farewell
  burst of positively fulsome appreciation.</p>

  </div>
  <p>KING HERBERT CAMPBELL THE FIRST, and HARRY PAYNE, the Clown, were
  sitting together, quaffing, after hours, and when work was done, just as
  in the good old times was the wont of <i>The King and the Cobbler</i>, or
  <i>The King and the Miller</i>. To them entered a Constable, intent on
  duty, and no respecter of persons. Often had he seen the Clown maltreat a
  policeman on the stage, nay, had seen him unstuff him, cut his head off
  and blow him limb from limb from a gun, and then put him together again;
  the only mistake being that the unfortunate official's head was turned
  the wrong way. So this Constable, too, looking backwards, as had done the
  poor pantomimic policeman, remembered all the slights, insults, and
  injuries, publicly inflicted on his cloth for many years, and now
  rejoiced&mdash;Ha! ha!&mdash;at last at having the Clown, the original
  JOEY, nay, the last of the JOEYS, in his grasp.</p>

  <p>Poor KING HERBERT the Merry Monarch the Constable pitied, but still
  "constabulary duty must be done," as he had heard sung; and remembering
  that my Lord Chief Justice, in days gone by, had sent off the Heir
  Apparent to prison, so now he the Constable, in the name of the Law,
  would hale KING HERBERT before the Magistrate. So King and Clown were had
  up accordingly. Did the Clown whimper, and cry, "Oh, please, Sir, it
  wasn't me, Sir; it was t'other boy, Sir!" and did the good King prepare
  to meet his fate like a man? and was he ready to put his head cheerfully
  on the wig-block and declare with his latest breath (up to 12.55 P.M.)
  that in his closing hours he died for the benefit of the Public? We know
  not&mdash;except that both delinquents were let off&mdash;like
  squibs&mdash;and Mine Host, the Boniface, had to pay all the fines. He at
  all events had a Fine old time of it! <i>Sic transit</i>! So fitly ends
  the long run of a good Pantomime. <i>Finis coronat opus</i>!</p>

  hope of their recovery; but now they have become "confirmed idiots."</p>

  </div>
  <p>IN reply to Mr. WOODALL, Mr. J.L. TOOLE said he was happy to come
  there. <i>Name is JOHN LAWRENCE TOOLE</i>? Yes. "JACK with my
  familiars,"&mdash;hem!&mdash;SHAKSPEARE. Being in Witness-box,&mdash;JACK
  in the Box. <i>What he would take</i>? Nothing, thanks, not even his
  oath. He was quite prepared to kiss the book&mdash;in the absence of the
  belle. Little joke that&mdash;has heard of "bell, book, and candle."
  Couldn't bring the candle in,&mdash;would if he could, though, just
  to&mdash;ahem!&mdash;make it a light entertainment. Would they excuse his
  glove? What did they want to know? <i>Whether the sanitary arrangements
  at his Theatre were good</i>? Rather&mdash;he could only say they were
  "fust-rate." A 1, in fact, like the performance. The house held over two
  thousand pounds, and was crowded nightly to see <i>Walker, London. Did he
  consider the structure safe</i>? Of course he did&mdash;safe as
  Houses&mdash;that is, safe as his houses for <i>Walker, London</i> were
  going to be for the next three years and a half, when his tenancy would
  expire, and he should then be in the Army. <i>Did the Committee want to
  know how it was that he would be in the Army</i>? He'd tell them;
  because, when he gave up that Theatre, he would be a "Left Tenant." Not
  bad that, for a beginner. We're a getting on, we are. As to
  ventilation&mdash;well, he couldn't have too much ventilation for
  <i>Walker, London</i>. He should like it aired everywhere. <i>Then the
  Committee might take it that he was satisfied with the structure</i>?
  Well&mdash;if they put it in that way&mdash;yes&mdash;he thought the
  structure a bit faulty&mdash;-but what's the odds as long as the public
  like the piece? He didn't consider <i>Walker, London</i>, a model of
  dramatic construction, but he looked upon the House Boat built on the
  stage as quite a model of construction; the end of the piece was a bit
  hazy, and he didn't yet know why everybody allowed him to go off with the
  punt, which they wouldn't get back, unless his friend, Mr. SHELTON, who
  was splendidly made up as a riverside boatman, brought it back, and,
  begging the Committee's pardon if they'd excuse his glove, he couldn't
  tell; not that it was a secret, because the clever author, a very nice
  retiring chap called BARRIE, hadn't confided it to
  him,&mdash;but&mdash;what was he saying?&mdash;oh, yes&mdash;he couldn't
  tell how it was all the characters on board didn't see ELIZA JOHNSON as
  <i>Sarah</i> in the punt. But as <i>Walker</i> says, "Oh, that's nothing!
  that's nothing!" <i>The Chairman wished to know if there is an egress at
  the back of the Theatre?</i> He (Mr. TOOLE) did not remember ever having
  seen a negress there. There were two beautiful young ladies&mdash;Miss
  IRENE VANBRUGH and Miss MARY ANSELL&mdash;now playing, and, he might say
  it who shouldn't, playing charmingly in <i>Walker, London</i>. <i>The
  Chairman didn't mean that</i>. No? But <i>he</i> (Mr. TOOLE) did, and he
  might add, though "it was nothing, a mere nothing," that the performance
  of his three young men&mdash;Mr. C.M. LOWNE, as the sensible lover; Mr.
  SEYMOUR HICKS, as the young medical student; and Mr. CECIL RAMSEY, as
  "W.G.," a youthful athlete, was admirable. They were all in <i>Walker,
  London</i>. In reply to Mr. T.H. BOLTON, who wished to know <i>if the
  Witness considered his Theatre a substantial edifice</i>, Mr. TOOLE said
  that he certainly did, because, you see, the Theatre would never go to
  pieces as long as the pieces went to the Theatre, and as long as it was
  supported by the public. <i>Have I any complaint</i>? Nothing to speak
  of, except a touch of gout. Oh, beg pardon, you meant <i>complaint as to
  the Theatre</i>? Oh, no, except it's not large enough to hold the
  millions who can't be crammed in nightly. Has an excellent Acting Manager
  in Mr. GEORGE LEE, and as to friend BILLINGTON'S stage-management of the
  House Boat (the scene, he might say, was painted by Mr. HARKER, a name
  not unknown at the Mansion House), it is the best thing of the sort ever
  done. Any evening that Mr. PLUNKET, Mr. WOODALL, or Mr. BOLTON, or any
  other of the Honourable Gentlemen would like to look in and see
  <i>Walker, London</i>, they have only to send to the Box Office, or any
  of the Libraries, and book in advance&mdash;he couldn't say fairer than
  that&mdash;because it was advice that he always gave to "Friend IRVING,"
  and which he had adopted. No more? Hope he doesn't intrude. Would the
  Committee excuse his glove? Yes? Then, remember, <i>Walker,
  London</i>.</p>

  <p>Mr. J.L. TOOLE then hurried out. After his departure it was found that
  all the spectators had on their backs adhesive labels advertising
  <i>Walker, London</i>.</p>

<h4>MR. PUNCH'S BOAT-RACE NOVEL.</h4>

<h3>STONYBROKE.</h3>

<p class="center">CHAPTER I.</p>

  <p>IT was the eve of the University Boat-Race. In the remote East the
  gorgeous August sun was sinking to his rest behind the purple clouds,
  gilding with his expiring rays the elevated battlements of Aginanwater
  Court, the ancestral seat of His Grace the Duke of AVADRYNKE, K.C.B.,
  G.I.N., whose Norman features might have been observed convulsively
  pressed against the plate-glass window of his alabaster dining-hall.
  There was in the atmosphere a strange electric hush, scarcely broken by
  the myriad voices of hoarse betting-men, raucously roaring out the market
  odds of "Fifty to one. Oxbridge!" or "Two ponies to a thick 'un,
  Camford!" Well would it have been for the Duke of AVADRYNKE had he never
  offered the hospitality of his famous river-side residence to the
  Oxbridge Crew. But the Duke had the courage of his ancient boating-race
  whose banner waved proudly upon the topmost turret, bearing upon its
  crimson folds the proud family motto, "<i>Dum Vivo Bibo</i>."</p>

  <p>And the sun went down, and within Aginanwater Court the sounds of wild
  revelry shook the massive beams.</p>

<p class="center">CHAPTER II.</p>

  <p>THE Oxbridge Crew still sat in the marble supper-room, amid the
  <i>débris</i> of the feast that the Duke's Seneschal had laid out for
  them. The floor was paved with Magnums and Maximums of the best
  Heidanseekerer champagne, most of them as empty as the foolish head of
  the Duchess of AVADRYNKE, which was at that moment reposing upon the
  brawny chest of Lord PODOPHLIN, the celebrated No. 5 of the Oxbridge
  Crew. On a raised dais at the end of the room the ladies of the Tarara
  <i>corps de ballet</i> were performing the final steps of the Sinuous
  Shadow-dance, specially dedicated to the Oxbridge Crew by the <i>chef
  d'orchestre</i> of Tarara's Halls.</p>

  <p>"May I be jiggered," observed the Oxbridge President, Sir WELFORARD
  LONGSTROKE, as he selected his fourth regalia from the Duke's
  pearl-encrusted box, and lit it with all the <i>abandon</i> of a Society
  darling, "may I be jiggered if this is not ripping! What say you?" he
  continued, addressing young PULYER WRIGHT, the Coxswain, and tossing him
  playfully four times to the raftered ceiling&mdash;"shall we not beat the
  dastard foe from Camford to-morrow?" A roar of applause sprang from the
  smoking mouths of his seven companions.</p>

  <p>But at this moment the Duchess of AVADRYNKE and Lord PODOPHLIN rose
  unobserved and quitted the room. In another minute the sound of hurrying
  wheels, gradually growing fainter in the distance, was heard by no one in
  the avenue. And the dance went on, and revelry rose to its maddest pitch.
  But no one, who, as has been recorded above, had heard the sound of the
  wheels, gave a thought to the Duke of AVADRYNKE, as he sat tearing his
  hair in the violet bedroom, having learnt from the faithful Seneschal the
  terrible news of the Duchess's elopement with the heir to the house of
  PODOPHLIN.</p>

<p class="center">CHAPTER III.</p>

  <p>THE morn of the race dawned clear and sparkling. Far as the eye could
  reach, the banks of the river were rich with Millions, and firm enough to
  bear any run upon them however heavy. But Sir WELFORARD LONGSTROKE was
  ill at ease. His No. 5 had fled leaving no trace, and he had no one to
  fill the vacancy. He looked the very model of an aquatic hero. His broad
  chest was loosely clad in a pair of blue satin shorts, and his fair hair
  fell in waving masses over his muscular back. His thoughts were bitter.
  The Camford crew had started on the race some ten minutes ago, and the
  Oxbridge craft still waited idly in the docks for want of a No. 5.</p>

      alt="Touching Finale." /></a>
    Touching Finale.
  </div>

  <p>"Surely," Sir WELFORARD thought to himself, "PODOPHLIN might have
  postponed the elopement for one day." A confused noise interrupted his
  meditations. Some ten yards from him a man roughly clad, but with the
  immense muscular development of the Arri Furnese Apollo, was engaged in
  fighting three bargees at once. As Sir WELFORARD stepped forward, this
  individual struck a terrible blow. His ponderous fist, urged by the force
  of a thirty-inch biceps, crashed through the chest of his first foe,
  severed the head of the second from his body, and struck the third, a
  tall man, full in the midriff, propelling him through the air into the
  middle of the river. "That's enough for one day," he said, as with an air
  of haughty melancholy he removed his clay-pipe from his mouth. His face
  seemed familiar to Sir WELFORARD. Who could he be? All doubt was removed
  when he advanced, grasped Sir WELFORARD by the hand, and, in tones broken
  with emotion, said, "Don't you recognise me? I am your old College chum,
  Viscount STONYBROKE."</p>

<p class="center">CHAPTER IV.</p>

  <p>"SAVED! Saved!" shouted Sir WELFORARD, joyously&mdash;"there is yet
  time!" Then, rushing into rhyme, he asked, "Will you row in the race, In
  PODOPHLIN'S place?"</p>

  <p>"Will I row in the race?" repeated Lord STONYBROKE&mdash;"just won't
  I!" And, without removing his hobnails, or his corduroys, he sprang
  lightly into the Oxbridge racing-boat. The rest is soon told. In less
  time than it takes to narrate the story, the Camford lead was wiped out.
  The exertion proved too much for seven men in the Oxbridge Crew, but the
  gigantic strength of the eighth, Lord STONYBROKE, was sufficient of
  itself to win the race by fifty lengths. And that night, when the Prime
  Minister handed to him the reward of victory in the shape of a massive
  gold dessert service, he was also able to announce that the STONYBROKE
  estates and the STONYBROKE title had been, by the Monarch's command,
  restored to their original possessor, as a reward of conspicuous valour
  and strength. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [THE END.]</p>

  SHEFFIELD, out of twenty-six matches they won thirteen, lost two, and
  eleven were drawn. The Eleven of course were drawn over and over again,
  <i>i.e.</i>, photographed. It will henceforth be a recommendation for any
  Cricketer to say he was out under this distinguished captaincy, as to
  this introduction the host will rejoin, "Ah, I know that man, he comes

  <p><i>House of Commons, Monday. March 28.</i>&mdash;Strange sight
  witnessed in House to-night. Subject of Debate, Indian Council Bill;
  Benches nearly full. Pup and dog, I've known the House for nineteen
  years, and never before saw the like. Explanation not found in fact of
  CURZON making his maiden speech as Minister in charge of Bill, though
  that had some influence at outset. Able speech it proved, our newest
  Minister having the great gift of lucidity. It was later than that when
  House filled, nearly two hours later, for in meantime SCHWANN had
  delivered Address as long as the Ganges, and MACLEAN (who was waiting his
  turn to speak) says, nearly as muddy.</p>

  <p>Curious how India seems to affect eminent orators, making them for the
  time pointless, dull, and above all, verbose. Probably no subject other
  than India could unite such galaxy of born orators and debaters. SWIFT
  MACNEILL, RICHARD TEMPLE, SAMUEL SMITH, OCTAVIUS MORGAN, JULIUS 'ANNIBAL
  PICTON and SEYMOUR-KEAY&mdash;one followed the other as in a necklet of
  diamonds gem succeeds gem, till the wearied eyesight can scarce decide
  which is the more brilliant. SEYMOUR-KEAY was, indeed, too much for the
  SPEAKER, who thrice called him to order, the last time with stern voice
  and threatening brow that made SEYMOUR tremble from the altitude of his
  boot-heels.</p>

  <p>It was none of these who filled the House with Members listening
  intently to a speech on internal affairs of India, It was Mr. G. who
  performed the miracle. No one expected to find him in this galley; being
  there, the banks were rapidly crowded with a throng lost in admiration of
  his strong, swift, graceful stroke. Difficult to say which the most
  admirable, the lofty height, far above the littleness of Party conflict,
  from which he surveyed the topic, the charm of his language or the
  dexterity with which, without seeming to rebuke the follower who had
  moved the Amendment and the eminent men who were prepared to support it,
  he sustained the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page180"
  id="page180"></a>[pg 180]</span> Ministry in their effort to reconstruct
  the Indian Councils, and suggested that the Amendment should with all
  haste be put into the fire. Whilst SCHWANN appropriated an hour of the
  Sitting, and SEYMOUR-KEAY exceeded that time, twenty-five minutes served
  Mr. G. for a speech delivered without note, apparently without
  preparation, and which left nothing more to be said.</p>

  <p>"Upon my word, Sir," I said, a little out of breath trying to keep
  pace with him running up the Duke of YORK'S steps going home to dinner,
  "you grow younger every year, and, if I may say so, mellower."</p>

  <p>"You certainly may say so, TOBY, if you like," he smilingly replied,
  "but the calendar says otherwise."</p>

  <p>"What," I asked&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"What has the calendar to do</p>

  <p>"Ah, I know that&mdash;with a slight difference. LOWELL wrote it to
  WENDEL HOLMES on his seventy-fifth birthday. I knew HOLMES too; he used
  to crow over me because he was just four months older, and yet, as he
  said, whilst I pleaded age as a reason why I could not visit the United
  States, he crossed the Atlantic at seventy-seven. Perhaps when I've got
  this Home-Rule question off my hands, I may find time to go to the United
  States."</p>

  leisure."</p>

  </div>
  <p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Some sensation created at Morning Sitting by
  discovery of CUNINGHAME GRAHAM addressing House from Conservative
  Benches. There was a well-known Member of the Parliament of 1874 who hit
  upon new device for, as he reckoned, doubling his chance of catching
  SPEAKER'S eye. Noted that SPEAKER called alternately upon Members from
  either side. If debate were opened from Opposition Benches, SPEAKER would
  next turn to other side of House, and call on Ministerialist. Happy
  thought occurred to our old friend. After rising several times from his
  seat below Gangway on Opposition Benches, and been passed over by SPEAKER
  in favour of another, he, whilst Member was speaking, crossed floor of
  House, and, when speech concluded, jumped up from other side. Being again
  ignored by the startled SPEAKER, went back to own place again to try his
  chances there. Don't remember that the man&#339;uvre was a success.
  Certainly not been generally adopted.</p>

  <p>GRAHAM seems now to have recurred to it; or can it be the case that
  he, too, has joined "the Gentlemen of England"? House so agitated by this
  problem, that it quite loses thread of debate; a thrilling discussion, to
  which FERGUSSON contributed a luminous speech, upon the Telephone.</p>

  <p>WILFRID LAWSON much interested in new development of affairs.</p>

  <p>"The Government," he says, "if only with the instincts of
  self-preservation, should hasten the Dissolution. If they go on a little
  longer, no saying what they may come to, with JOE as their principal
  champion in town and country, with JOHN REDMOND as their favourite
  orator; led into the Lobby the other day by BURT against the Eight Hours
  Bill, they only want to recruit CUNINGHAME GRAHAM to their ranks to make
  the medley complete. If they go on another three months, we shall see
  them some Sunday following CUNINGHAME GRAHAM'S red flag as he leads them
  to Trafalgar Square, there to be addressed by Alderman JOHN BURNS."</p>

  <p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Scotch Members made a night of it. Great muster
  of the Clans. Government have £265,000 to make over to Scotland in relief
  of Local Taxation and promotion of Education. Scotch Members don't object
  to the money, but take exception to its plan of distribution. Member
  after Member rises from Opposition Benches, biting at hand that proffers
  the boon. "Crude and wasteful," BUCHANAN calls this scheme, and Scotch
  Members lustily cheer.</p>

  <p>A capital debate of its kind, but not picturesque; Benches empty, only
  the LORD-ADVOCATE on the Treasury Bench.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you how you can manage these fellows, my dear CASABLANCA,"
  said JEMMY LOWTHER, crossing the Gangway, and seating himself for a
  moment by the solitary Minister.</p>

  <p>"Beg your pardon, my name is PEARSON."</p>

  <p>"Of course," said JEMMY, "I know very well; only a quotation; thinking
  of the Boy who stood on the burning deck, whence all but he had fled,
  doncha. Was going to tell you how you can get out of this trouble.
  Fellows opposite righteously indignant at your proposed disposition of
  money. Very well; you get up, say you're sorry to have offended; had no
  idea you'd made such a mistake; only atonement you can offer is to
  withdraw the proposed grant altogether. Then you'll see how they'll sit
  up."</p>

  <p>"Excellent idea," said LORD-ADVOCATE. "Shall mention it to GOSCHEN
  when he comes back&mdash;if he ever does," he added with weary voice,
  looking down the deserted Bench. Scotch Members, all unconscious of JEMMY
  LOWTHER'S machination, went on talking till midnight, when debate stood
  adjourned.</p>

  nothing. Radicals look angry at being thus put off; show signs of
  intention to discuss the matter. Mr. G. interposes; makes one of his
  bland speeches; wouldn't press question now (a suggestion that pleases
  Ministers); by-and-by time will come, then we shall see; whereat SAGE and
  his friends brighten up; Mr. G. sits down having pleased everybody; storm
  blown off.</p>

  <p>Curious to note the altered condition in atmosphere of House since Mr.
  G. came back. Turmoil stopped; restlessness soothed; Ministerial work
  goes on smoothly, whilst the GRAND OLD PACIFICATOR looks on
  benevolently.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said PRINCE ARTHUR, uneasily, "this is all very well. He holds
  back the curs that would snap at our heels; but it's only because he, a
  wilier tactician, knows that no practical advantage is to be gained from
  that kind of sport. Wait till he thinks the hour has struck, and you'll
  see he'll not only let slip the dogs of war, but lead the rush
  himself."</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
